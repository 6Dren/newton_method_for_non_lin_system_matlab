# Newton Method for Non-Linear Systems (MATLAB)

## Overview

This repository contains a MATLAB script that implements the Newton method to solve non-linear equations. The script utilizes the Jacobian matrix and numerical derivatives to find the roots of non-linear functions.

## Features

- Solves systems of non-linear equations using the Newton method.
- Computes the Jacobian matrix numerically.
- Allows for customizable input functions and initial guesses.

## Requirements

- MATLAB (version R2016b or later recommended)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/6Dren/newton_method_for_non_lin_system_matlab.git
